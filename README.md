Aurelia-Widgets

A widget library for the Aurelia Javascript Framework.  It is bootstrap-oriented, in that these widgets have the layout and class necessary for bootstrap styling.

Widgets Available:

- Autocomplete [*NOTE* Removed in v2.0.0 now available at github.com/drivesoftware/aurelia-autocomplte]
- Checkbox
- Combo Box
- Currency Input
- Radio Button
- Text Display
- Text Input
- Toggle Button

All the input widgets (except the Toggle Button) have a grab-focus attribute which, when set to true, will focus the main input of the widget.

### Autocomplete

*NOTE* Removed in v2.0.0 now available at github.com/drivesoftware/aurelia-autocomplte

Should have a `lookup` bound to an object that has a `search(inputText)` function.  This will return a Promise that resolves to an object of the form:
```
{
    suggestions: [ { value: "Text for the input", data: { } }, { value: "...", data: {...} }, ... ]
}
```

### Radio Button

Each radio button must have:
  - a non-empty, unique (within the group) `label`
  - a `group-name`

Optionally, it can also have a function bound to `onselecting`, e.g. `<radio-button onselecting.call="someFunction()"></radio-button>`
This should return true to allow the selection to go ahead, or false to leave the button group in the previously selected state.
By default, this action is always allowed.


### Checkbox
Can optionally have a function bound to `ontoggle`,  e.g. `<checkbox ontoggle.call="someFunction()"></checkbox>` which is
called whenever the widget is checked or unchecked.


### Currency Input
This will allow all characters to be entered (to more easily not penalise power users using `Home`, `Tab`, etc) but if the input
can't be parsed as a number, then the value will be reset and the value will be left as NaN

### Text Display
This is intended to be a limited text area, which will then add a tooltip to show the full text.  It works best when
`white-space` is set to `nowrap` on the `.text-display` class.

### Toggle Button
This is a switch, with a checkbox underneath (hence "checked" as an attribute).  Bindable attributes are:
- on-text : When the switch is "checked" this text will be displayed
- off-text : When the switch is "unchecked" this text will be displayed
- width : the width of the toggle in pixels (should be an integer), default is null which should be 'auto' but doesn't work as well as it should
- checked : whether the switch is "checked"
- disabled : whether the toggle is able to be operated

### Text Widget
Binadable attributes are:
- multiline : Whether to use an `<input type="text">` or a `<textarea>`
- text-value : The text value for the widget
- disabled : whether the control is disabled
- readonly : The multi-line expanding will still function (unlike disabled) but the text is not editable

The multi-line Text input animates expanding and collapsing from the original size (as calculated from style properties) to the "optimal" size (meaning
all text will be displayed without scroll bars).  It also automatically exapands to fit the text added to it as it happens.

#### Known Issues:
- The Checkboxes don't have their text vertically centered in Firefox.  This is because flex layout is not supported in buttons in Firefox
